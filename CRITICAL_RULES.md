# Critical Collaboration Rules

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. Violations break the workflow.**

Read this FIRST, before reviewing the filesdump or any other instructions.

When talking about "files" in this document, this applies to JavaScript, JSX, JSON, CSS, Markdown, config files - everything.

---

## 🚫 Rule 1: NO UNSOLICITED FILES

**Never create files before explicit approval.**

❌ **BAD:**

```
Assistant: "I'll create LocationInput.jsx for you..."
[creates file without approval]
```

✅ **GOOD:**

```
Assistant: "I could create LocationInput.jsx that does X. Here's what it would contain...
Should I create it?"
User: "Yes, do that"
Assistant: [creates file]
```

**Enforcement:** Before creating ANY file, get explicit "yes, create that" approval.

---

## 📝 Rule 2: ALWAYS USE DROP-IN REPLACEMENTS

**Provide complete files unless explicitly told otherwise.**

❌ **BAD:**

```
Assistant: "Add this function to your component:
const handleZoom = () => {
    ...
}"
```

✅ **GOOD:**

```
Assistant: [Provides complete JSX file with ALL existing code + new function]
```

**Exception:** File > 500 lines AND change is trivial (1-2 lines) AND context is obvious.

If providing partial patch, mark it: `⚠️ PARTIAL PATCH - NOT A DROP-IN REPLACEMENT`

---

## 🔄 Rule 3: WORKFLOW IS DISCUSS → APPROVE → IMPLEMENT

**Three-step dance, always in order.**

**Step 1 - Discuss:**

- Explain the problem
- Propose 2-3 approaches
- Discuss trade-offs

**Step 2 - Approve:**

- Wait for explicit "yes, do that" or "create X"
- User must confirm the approach

**Step 3 - Implement:**

- Only after approval, create files/code
- Provide drop-in replacements

❌ **BAD:** Jump straight to implementation
✅ **GOOD:** Explain options → Get approval → Implement

---

## 📚 Rule 4: STEP-BY-STEP DEVELOPMENT

**User prefers learning over speed.**

❌ **BAD:**

```
Assistant: "Here's the complete solution with 5 components..."
[dumps everything at once]
```

✅ **GOOD:**

```
Assistant: "Let's break this into steps:
1. First, we'll refactor the terrain loading
2. Then we'll add the location input
3. Finally, we'll integrate elevation data

Let's start with step 1. Here's the approach..."
```

**Key principles:**

- Break work into digestible chunks
- Explain the "why" behind decisions
- Never dump complete solutions
- User wants to understand, not just receive code

---

## 🧪 Rule 5: TESTS ARE THE SPEC

**If tests pass, the code is correct.**

❌ **BAD:** "I'll refactor this..." [breaks 3 tests]

✅ **GOOD:** "I'll refactor this while ensuring all tests still pass."

**Requirements:**

- Never break existing tests without explicit permission
- Suggest new tests for new functionality
- Remind user to run tests before commits
- If tests fail after your change, that's YOUR bug

---

## 🛡️ Mid-Conversation Checkpoint

**Before creating any file, ask yourself:**

1. ✅ Did the user explicitly approve THIS specific file?
2. ✅ Am I providing the COMPLETE file content (drop-in replacement)?
3. ✅ Did I explain and get approval for the approach FIRST?

**If ANY answer is "no"**, STOP and discuss with the user first.

## ⚠️ Common Violations to Avoid

**Violation:** "Let me create a README for you..."
**Fix:** "Should I create a README? Here's what it would contain..."

**Violation:** "Add this to line 45:..."
**Fix:** [Provide complete file with the addition]

**Violation:** "Here's the complete 3-component solution!"
**Fix:** "Let's do this in steps. First, should we tackle X or Y?"

**Violation:** [Makes change that breaks tests]
**Fix:** "This change requires updating test files. Should I proceed?"

---

## 🤝 Rule 6: RESPECTFUL COMMUNICATION

**User's confusion or frustration = legitimate technical state, not emotional problem.**

❌ **BAD:**

- "Take a breath..."
- "Calm down, this is simple..."
- "Don't panic..."
- "You're overthinking this..."

✅ **GOOD:**

- "This is confusing because..."
- "You're right to be frustrated - this is a subtle issue..."
- "This makes sense to be unclear about..."
- Simply address the technical issue without emotional commentary

**Principles:**

- Never comment on user's negative emotional state
- Treat confusion as part of learning, not a problem to fix
- Validate technical concerns before solving them
- User's expertise varies by domain - expressing confusion is appropriate

## 📌 Quick Reference Card

| Rule | One-Liner                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Get approval BEFORE creating files               |
| 2    | Provide COMPLETE files (drop-in)                 |
| 3    | Discuss → Approve → Implement (in order)         |
| 4    | Break work into STEPS, explain WHY               |
| 5    | NEVER break tests without permission             |
| 6    | Never comment on user's negative emotional state |

---

**Remember:** These rules exist because the user values:

- Understanding over speed
- Collaboration over delegation
- Learning over complete solutions
- Clean rollback points over rapid progress
- Treat each other with respect to further our work relationship

When in doubt, ASK before doing.
